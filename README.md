# Number Predictor (Flutter) ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

This is a replica of the [Number Predictor project](https://github.com/raj-pulapakura/Number-Predictor) by *Raj Pulapakura*, but created using Flutter (instead of using Kotlin like in the original project).

How Number Predictor works is, to take the rules from the app itself: 

1. Think of a number from 1 to 30.
2. Remember this number.
3. You will be shown 5 slides.
4. On each slide,  YES if your number is there, or NO if it is not.
5. At the end of the five slides, your number will be magically guessed.
